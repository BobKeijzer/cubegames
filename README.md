# Cube Games

A collection of simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript games I created for fun and learning.

## Games
- **Cube Chaos**: Dodge the cubes by steering through the chaos!
- **Cube Crash**: Jump over or fall below the cubes to avoid crashing!
- **Cube Jump**: Keep jumping on the falling cubes without falling off!
- **Cube Rush**: Evade the cubes and rush through them!

## How to Play
